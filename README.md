# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis

The goal of this program is to determine how "happy" twitter users are in each timezone of the world, based on the words used in each of their tweets.

This program reads prompts a user for two files: one containing the tweets to be analyzed, and another containing keywords + their respective scores. Then, the program then assigns a dictionary to the keywords with their respective scores. The program then separates tweets depending on their coordinate locations, and assigns a score to each tweet in that region. The scores of all tweets in the region are then summed up and printed onto the screen, along with the number of tweets in that region

#NOTE**: region1 = EST, region2 = CST, region3 = MST, region4 = PST
